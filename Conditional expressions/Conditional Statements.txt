#Using one of the comparison operators in Python, 
#write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input,
#which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100,
#and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

#Code

n = float(input(Enter Number))
n < 100
print(False)
n >= 100
print(True)

# How to identify the largest of two numbers

#Code

# Read two numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Choose the larger number
if number1 > number2:
    larger_number = number1
else:
    larger_number = number2

# Print the result
print("The larger number is:", larger_number)

# How to identify the largest of three numbers

# Read three numbers
number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
number3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))

# We temporarily assume that the first number
# is the largest one.
# We will verify this soon.
largest_number = number1

# We check if the second number is larger than current largest_number
# and update largest_number if needed.
if number2 > largest_number:
    largest_number = number2

# We check if the third number is larger than current largest_number
# and update largest_number if needed.
if number3 > largest_number:
    largest_number = number3

# Print the result
print("The largest number is:", largest_number)
