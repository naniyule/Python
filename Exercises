#Using one of the comparison operators in Python, 
#write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input,
#which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100,
#and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

#Code

n = float(input(Enter Number))
n < 100
print(False)
n >= 100
print(True)
