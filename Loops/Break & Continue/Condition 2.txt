#Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:
#a for loop;
#the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
#the continue statement.
#Your program must:

#ask the user to enter a word;
#use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; 
#use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
#print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.

#Code

# Prompt the user to enter a word
# and assign it to the user_word variable.

user_word = input("Please enter a word: ")
user_word = user_word.upper()

for letter in user_word:
    # Complete the body of the for loop.
    if letter == "A":
        continue
    elif letter == "E":
        continue
    elif letter == "I":
        continue
    elif letter == "O":
        continue
    elif letter == "U":
        continue
    else:
        print(letter)
