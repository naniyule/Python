#Design a program that uses a while loop 
#and continuously asks the user to enter a word 
#unless the user enters "chupacabra" as the secret exit word, 
#in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." 
#should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.
#Don't print any of the words entered by the user. 
#Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

#Code

word = input ("Enter a word: ")
while True: #Evaluates statement and loops as long as a word is entered
    if word != "chupacabra":
        print("You're stuck in an infinite loop")
        word = input ("Enter another word: ")
    elif word == "chupacabra":
        print("You've successfully left the loop.")
    break
